## Design Philosophy

**Brand Tone:**  
Luxury, calm, intelligent, confident. Feels like a founder operating system, not a marketing page.

**Visual Style:**  
- Light off-white or soft neutral backgrounds
- Deep charcoal text for readability
- One restrained accent color (emerald, sage, or similar muted tone)
- Serif typefaces for headlines, sans-serif for body
- Generous whitespace and breathing room
- No heavy shadows, no neon, no loud gradients
- Editorial and architectural layout quality

**Typography Hierarchy:**  
- Large serif headlines (48-72px desktop)
- Medium sans-serif subheadings (18-24px)
- Small body text (14-16px)
- Uppercase eyebrows with wide letter spacing (10-12px)

**Animation Principles:**  
- Subtle and calm
- Scroll-triggered reveals
- Short durations (200-400ms)
- No bounce, no flash, no loops
- Graceful fades and small movements
