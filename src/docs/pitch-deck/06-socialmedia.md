```

**Helper Text:**
```
Integrations reduce friction and create lock-in. Be specific about platform names.
```

**Why This Matters:**
Integrations are a strong moat in CRM/social AI. Investors want to see you've thought through the tech stack and can plug into existing workflows seamlessly.

- Efficiency metrics: time saved, posts automated, consistency

**Avoid:**
- Generic claims: "content AI," "smart posting"
- Vague metrics: "better content," "more engagement"
- Technical jargon: algorithms, NLP, sentiment analysis

---

### Focus Areas

1. **Automation Leverage:** How much manual work does AI replace?
2. **Engagement Impact:** Does content perform better with AI?
3. **Integration Depth:** How deeply embedded in existing workflows?
4. **Lead Connection:** Can you tie social content to leads or revenue?

---

### AI Behavior

- AI suggests, founder decides
- No auto-fill without permission
- Growth and engagement-focused suggestions only
- Practical, workflow-centric advice

---

## Content Strategy

### What CRM/Social Media Investors Expect

1. **Automation Scale:** Can this work across 10+ social accounts?
2. **Engagement Proof:** Does AI content actually perform?
3. **Integration Network Effect:** More integrations = stronger moat
4. **Lead Attribution:** Can you connect social to revenue?
5. **Time Savings:** How much faster is content creation?

- At least 1 integration selected

**Ideal State:**

---

## AI Suggestion Logic

### Trigger: "Clarify CRM → content workflow"

**When to show:**
- "CRM" integration selected
- But no mention of: "lead," "contact," "pipeline," "follow-up"

**Suggested improvement:**
"Explain how social content flows into CRM. Example: 'Social engagement triggers CRM tasks' or 'AI enriches CRM profiles with social data.'"

---

### Trigger: "Add engagement or lead metrics"

**When to show:**
- No metrics provided
- OR metrics don't include: "engagement," "leads," "CTR," "conversion"

**Suggested improvement:**
"Tie automation to results. Example: 'Engagement rate increased by X%' or 'Generated Y leads per month from social.'"

---

### Trigger: "Highlight automation depth"

**When to show:**
- Solution text < 100 characters
- OR no mention of: "automate," "schedule," "generate," "monitor"

**Suggested improvement:**
"Specify what AI automates. Example: 'AI generates 20 posts/week and schedules across 5 platforms' instead of 'AI helps with content.'"

---
