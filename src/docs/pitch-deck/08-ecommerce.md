## Layout Structure

### Three-Column Layout

**Left Column:** Wizard steps (Step 2 highlighted)  
**Center Column:** Industry-specific questions  
**Right Column:** AI suggestions

**Background:** Light (#FFFFFF)  
**Spacing:** Clean, generous  
**UI:** Minimal, commerce-focused

---

## Left Column — Wizard Progress

### Step Indicator

```
Step 2 of 5 — Industry Focus

Progress:
• Startup Info ✓ (completed)
• Industry Focus (active)
• Market & Traction
• Deck Style
• Review & Generate
```

**Helper Text:**
```

```

---

## Center Column — Content

### Title

```
Industry Focus: eCommerce
```

### Subtitle

```
Position your product around revenue, conversion, and scale.
```

**Typography:** Large title, smaller subtitle in gray

---

### Question 1 — Target Customer

**Label:**
```
Who is the customer?
```

**Input Type:** Textarea (2 rows)

**Placeholder:**
```
DTC brands and online retailers selling through Shopify and marketplaces
```

**Character Limit:** 150 characters

**Helper Text:**
```
Be specific: DTC brands, marketplace sellers, omnichannel retailers, or specific verticals (fashion, beauty, etc.).
```

**Why This Matters:**
eCommerce encompasses diverse segments—from DTC Shopify stores to Amazon sellers to enterprise omnichannel retailers. Each has different tech stacks, budgets, and pain points. Investors want focus.

---

### Question 2 — Core Commerce Problem

**Label:**
```
What commerce problem exists today?
```

**Input Type:** Textarea (3 rows)

**Placeholder:**
```
Stores struggle to convert traffic and personalize experiences at scale
```

**Character Limit:** 200 characters

**Helper Text:**
```
Frame problem around revenue loss (cart abandonment, low conversion) or operational waste (manual merchandising).
```

---

### Question 3 — AI-Powered Solution

**Label:**
```
How does AI improve eCommerce performance?
```

**Input Type:** Textarea (3 rows)

**Placeholder:**
```
AI personalizes product recommendations and optimizes pricing in real time
```

**Character Limit:** 200 characters

**Helper Text:**
```
Emphasize what AI automates: personalization, pricing, merchandising, or inventory.
```

---

### Question 4 — Integrations & Platforms

**Label:**
```
What platforms does this integrate with?
```

**Input Type:** Multi-select (select all that apply)

**Options:**

**Additional Text Field (optional):**
```
Additional integrations:
Placeholder: "BigCommerce, Facebook Shops, email marketing tools"
```

**Helper Text:**
```
Platform integrations reduce setup friction and create lock-in. Be specific about supported platforms.
```

**Why This Matters:**
eCommerce tools live or die by platform integrations. Shopify has different APIs than WooCommerce. Amazon sellers have unique needs. Investors want to see you understand platform fragmentation and have a strategy.

---

```

**Input Type:** Multi-select (select up to 2)

## UX Rules

### Language Guidelines

**Use:**
- Commerce language: conversion, AOV, cart abandonment, LTV, GMV
- Revenue terms: revenue per visitor, attributed revenue, margin
- Efficiency metrics: inventory turnover, time saved, automation
- Platform names: Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce (not "platforms")

**Avoid:**
- Generic AI claims: "smarter recommendations," "better personalization"
- Vague metrics: "increased sales" (specify conversion or AOV)
- Technical jargon: neural networks, collaborative filtering

---

### Focus Areas

1. **Revenue Impact:** How much does AI increase conversion or AOV?
2. **Speed to Value:** How quickly do retailers see lift?
3. **Platform Fit:** Which platforms work best with your AI?
4. **Scale Proof:** Does AI work for 1M+ monthly visitors?

---

### AI Behavior

- AI suggests, founder decides
- No auto-fill without permission
- Revenue and conversion-focused suggestions only
- Practical, commerce-specific advice

---

## Content Strategy

### What eCommerce Investors Expect

1. **Revenue Metrics:** Clear impact on conversion, AOV, or revenue per visitor
2. **Fast ROI:** eCommerce moves fast—investors expect weeks, not months
3. **Platform Strategy:** Can you win on Shopify, then expand to WooCommerce?
4. **Scale Proof:** Does AI work for small stores and large retailers?
5. **Attribution:** Can you prove AI drove the revenue lift?

---

### Key Metrics for eCommerce

**Revenue Metrics:**
- Conversion rate (%)
- Average order value (AOV) ($)
- Revenue per visitor ($)
- Gross merchandise value (GMV) ($)
- Revenue attributed to AI ($)

**Efficiency Metrics:**

- Repeat purchase rate (%)
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) ($)

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Missing revenue metrics (conversion, AOV, revenue per visitor)
- ❌ Vague platform strategy ("works with all eCommerce platforms")
- ❌ No attribution proof (can't prove AI caused the lift)
- ❌ Ignoring platform economics (Shopify vs. Amazon margins differ)
- ❌ Focusing on features instead of revenue outcomes

## AI Suggestion Logic

### Trigger: "Tighten revenue framing"

**When to show:**
- Problem text doesn't mention: "revenue," "conversion," "cart," "AOV," "sales"
- OR problem is < 100 characters

**Suggested improvement:**
"Quantify revenue loss. Example: '$2M lost annually to cart abandonment' or 'Low 2.1% conversion rate costs $500K per year.'"

---

### Trigger: "Add commerce benchmarks"

**When to show:**
- No metrics provided
- OR metrics don't include: "conversion," "AOV," "revenue," "cart abandonment"

**Suggested improvement:**
"Add industry context. Example: 'Conversion rate: 3.2% (vs. 2.5% industry average)' or 'AOV increased 35% vs. control group.'"

---

### Trigger: "Highlight platform integrations"

**When to show:**
- Fewer than 2 integrations selected
- OR no mention of specific platforms (Shopify, Amazon, etc.)

**Suggested improvement:**
"Name platforms and integration depth. Example: 'Native Shopify app' or 'Amazon API integration for dynamic pricing.'"

---
