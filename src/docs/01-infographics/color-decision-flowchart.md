## Section Background Alternation

### For Multi-Section Pages:

```
PATTERN:
Dark section → Light section → Dark section → Light section

ACCENT STRATEGY:
Hero (Dark): Sage/Emerald
§1 (Light): Warm accent (Gold, Coral) or Violet
§2 (Dark): Cool accent (Violet, Teal) or Blue
§3 (Light): Warm accent (Gold) or Blue
§4 (Dark): Cool accent (Violet, Blue, Teal)
§5 (Light): Any accent based on content
Closing (Light): Emerald (brand)
```

### Balance Principles:

1. **Alternate light/dark** for visual rhythm
2. **Warm accents on light** backgrounds (gold, coral, violet)
3. **Cool accents on dark** backgrounds (blue, violet, teal)
4. **Max 2 accents per section** (avoid rainbow effect)
5. **Group related sections** with same color family

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ **Don't use blue for AI learning**
- Wrong: "AI learns your habits" + Blue
- Right: "AI learns your habits" + Violet

❌ **Don't use violet for static security**
- Wrong: "Encrypted storage" + Violet
- Right: "Encrypted storage" + Blue

❌ **Don't use gold for non-financial analytics**
- Wrong: "User engagement analytics" + Gold
- Right: "User engagement analytics" + Emerald or Violet

❌ **Don't mix warm and cool accents in same section**
- Wrong: Gold card + Blue card + Teal card
- Right: Gold card + Coral card (both warm)

❌ **Don't use more than 2 accent colors per section**
- Creates visual chaos and dilutes meaning

## Testing Checklist

Before finalizing color choice, ask:

- [ ] Does this color's semantic meaning match the content?
- [ ] Is contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1 for text?
- [ ] Am I alternating light/dark section backgrounds?
- [ ] Am I using warm accents on light, cool on dark (mostly)?
- [ ] Have I limited to max 2 accent colors in this section?
- [ ] Would a colorblind user still understand the hierarchy?
- [ ] Does this fit the calm, sophisticated brand tone?
