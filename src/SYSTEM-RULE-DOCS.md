# SYSTEM RULE: Documentation Standards

## ❌ STOP CREATING MULTIPLE SUMMARY DOCS

### Rule
**ONE checklist with short summary per feature. That's it.**

### ❌ Don't Do This:
- Multiple documentation files
- Separate summary files
- Redundant explanations
- Verbose documentation

### ✅ Do This Instead:
**ONE file with:**
- [ ] What was built
- [ ] Files changed
- [ ] How to access/test
- [ ] Done

**Max length: 50 lines**
