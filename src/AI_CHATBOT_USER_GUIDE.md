│                    [HIGH IMPACT] ← Badge

│ ─────────────────────────────────── │
│ ╭───────────────────────────────╮   │

## 💬 Best Practices

### **✅ DO:**

1. **Ask for next steps** when you're stuck
   - "What should I do next?"
   - "Where do I start?"

2. **Request reviews** before investor meetings
   - "Review my readiness"
   - "Check my pitch deck"

3. **Use quick actions** for common tasks
   - Fastest way to get help

4. **Preview before applying**
   - Always read AI suggestions
   - Edit if needed

5. **Dismiss what doesn't fit**
   - AI learns from your preferences
   - Don't apply everything

### **❌ DON'T:**

1. **Auto-apply everything**
   - Read and think first
   - Your judgment matters

2. **Ignore impact badges**
   - HIGH = do this soon
   - LOW = can wait

3. **Skip the preview**
   - Make sure it fits your brand
   - AI isn't perfect

4. **Forget to ask follow-ups**
   - "Can you explain more?"
   - "Why is this important?"

## 🏆 Success Tips

### **1. Check in Daily**
Open the chat each time you work on your startup. Get oriented: "What should I focus on today?"

### **2. Use Stage-Based Guidance**  
Your needs change as you grow. AI adapts - but you need to update your stage when you progress.

### **3. Ask "Why?"**
When AI suggests something, ask why it matters. Build your understanding, not just your documents.

### **4. Review Before Meetings**
Before any investor or customer meeting: "Review my [pitch deck / canvas / readiness]"

### **5. Generate, Then Refine**
Let AI create the first draft, then make it yours. Don't apply without reviewing.

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **"AI isn't responding"**
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page
- Try a simpler question first

### **"Suggestions don't fit my startup"**
- Update your startup stage in settings
- Provide more context: "I'm a B2B SaaS company..."
- Dismiss what doesn't fit - AI learns

### **"I don't see action cards"**
- Make sure you're asking for something specific
- Try: "Help me with [specific task]"
- Action cards appear for suggestions, not all messages

### **"Wrong context showing"**
- Navigate to the correct screen first
- Or tell AI: "I'm working on my pitch deck"
